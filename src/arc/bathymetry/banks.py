"""Finding a cross section's banks, as distances from the stream cell.

Every method gives the distance from the stream cell to each bank, which can fall between ordinates, and the
channel's top width is the sum of the two. A search tries the methods in legacy ARC's order and keeps the first
that resolves a channel at least two ordinate spacings wide, unless a drainage-area width prior says the channel is
a single cell. See the package notes for how this differs from the legacy bank indices.
