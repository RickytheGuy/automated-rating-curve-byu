"""Carving the bathymetry into a cross section.

A channel is carved as a trapezoid between its banks, however wide it is, narrower than a cell included. Its top is
at the reference level at the banks, and its sides slope down to the bed over trapezoid_height of the top width,
measured from the nearer bank. Its bed is flat, depth below the reference level. A channel without valid banks is
carved one cell wide (single_cell_banks).

The carve does two things. The ordinates between the banks, the banks included, take the channel's elevation there.
Those are what the bathymetry raster and the cross-section file get, so a channel narrower than a cell sets just its
stream cell, to the bed. And the cross section gets the channel's exact profile (XSection.profile), for the
hydraulics: the ground outside the banks, the channel's corners between them, and the ground running straight from
each bank's top out to the first ordinate beyond it, as it ran between ordinates before. On the ordinates alone a
channel couldn't be narrower than two spacings, and a trapezoid a few spacings wide came out another shape: one two
spacings wide was a triangle, with 5/8 of the area of the trapezoid its depth was solved for (at a trapezoid height of
0.2).

Without bank elevations the reference level is the stream cell's elevation, the channel only ever lowers the ground,
and a depth of 25 m or more isn't carved at all. With bank elevations (Bathy_Use_Banks) the reference level is the
bank elevation given, and the channel sets the ground whether that raises or lowers it.
