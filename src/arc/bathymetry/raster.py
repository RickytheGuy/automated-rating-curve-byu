"""Linking a sampled cross section's ordinates to raster cells, to read land cover and to write bathymetry, and
filling the gaps the cross sections leave in the bathymetry raster.

Each ordinate belongs to the cell nearest to it. Sampling steps one cell along whichever axis the cross section
crosses fastest, so consecutive ordinates are in different cells.

Once every cross section is burned in, fill_bathymetry_gaps fills a cell without bathymetry that has some in at
least four of the eight cells around it with their mean (legacy _fill_bathymetry_nan_cells). Without
Bathy_Use_Banks, legacy first dropped the cells whose bathymetry was above the DEM, since the channel should only
lower the ground, and fill_bathymetry_gaps does that too when given the DEM. carve_channel needs it as well: it only
lowers the cross section's own elevations, and on a cross section at an angle those are interpolated, so a cell's own
ground can be lower. (Between the two steps, legacy took off the 100 m it had added to a DEM with elevations below
0 m, which this code doesn't add.)

Errors in the legacy code, not repeated here
--------------------------------------------
- Without Bathy_Use_Banks, dropping the cells above the DEM came before filling the gaps, and the gaps could be
  filled above it. A cell the channel wasn't carved into because the ground there was already below its bed, as in
  a pool, took the bed around it: in a channel carved to 95 m, a pool at 94 m was filled to 95 m. Here a gap isn't
  filled above the ground.
