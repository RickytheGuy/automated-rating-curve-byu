"""How deep a cross section's channel is below its reference level, from baseflow or a drainage-area power law.

The reference level is the water surface the DEM shows at the stream cell, or with bank elevations
(Bathy_Use_Banks) the bank elevation given. The channel carries the baseflow with its water at the reference level,
by Manning's equation with the roughness given: arc.pipeline gives the water class's n from the Manning's n table,
which is the n the channel has between its banks. Legacy ARC used a fixed 0.03 whatever the table said
(LEGACY_MANNINGS_N), which is still the default here. It is a trapezoid as wide as its banks at the
reference level, whose sloping sides each take up trapezoid_height of that width, whatever the depth: however wide it
is, narrower than a cell included. A channel without valid banks is taken to be one cell wide (single_cell_banks).

Legacy ARC stepped the depth up until the discharge passed the baseflow, in steps down to 1 cm for a trapezoid
(stopping just short of the answer). This solves for the depth exactly. Legacy's single-cell channel was a triangle
reaching the ordinates either side, stepped 10 cm at a time; a single cell here is a trapezoid like any other channel
(see the package notes).
